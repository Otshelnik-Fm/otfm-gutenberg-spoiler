== Description ==

WordPress 5.0 introduces a block-based editor (codename "Gutenberg") that offers a streamlined editing experience.
The plugin provides in the block editor 2 types of spoilers:

* Little Spoiler
* Box spoiler

Little Spoiler - small spoiler for plain text.

Box spoiler - consists of 2 blocks:
Opening spoiler (Box Spoiler Start) and closing spoiler (Box Spoiler End)
Between them, you insert any block (or several block's) with content that you want to hide.

In the frontend, the spoiler (accordion) opens with animation.
In the editor you can choose the color design of the spoiler.

Ability to add new colors or replace a set of colors. See FAQ
